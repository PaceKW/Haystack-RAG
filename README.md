   To ensure that your project dependencies are isolated, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

   - **Install `venv` (if not already installed):**
     Make sure you have Python installed. The `venv` module is included with Python 3.3 and later. You can check your Python version with:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

   - **Create a virtual environment:**
     Run the following command in your project directory:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```

   - **Activate the virtual environment:**
     - On **Windows:**
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **macOS and Linux:**
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key:**
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Install dependencies:**
   After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the application:**
   With the virtual environment activated, you can run your application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application in your browser:**
   Open `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

8. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**
